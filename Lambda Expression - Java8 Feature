Lambda Expression - Java 8 Feature

Java Lambda expressions are new feature in Java 8. Java lambda
expressions are Javas first step into functional programming. A Java
lambda expression is thus a function which can be created without
belonging to any class. A lambda expression can be passed around as if it
was an object and executed on demand.
When you define the lambda object you are essentially implementing a
single method from an interface. The lambda object implements that
interface. But - defining a lambda does not execute it. It only defines it.
You still need to explicitly call the interface method to execute the lambda, or
pass the lambda on to another method which calls that interface method.
A lambda expression is characterized by the following syntax -
parameter -> expression body.
